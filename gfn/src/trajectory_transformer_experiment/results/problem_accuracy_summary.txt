- Expected: Hardest problem type

=== Analysis by Difficulty ===

Easy Problems (149, 154):
- Average Accuracy: 0.0%
- Expected: Should perform better, but grid size issues prevent success

Medium Problems (86, 139, 178):  
- Average Accuracy: 0.0%
- Grid size mismatch is primary issue

Hard Problems (240, 379):
- Average Accuracy: 0.5%
- Surprising that only success came from hard problem
- May indicate some pattern recognition working despite size issues

=== Key Findings ===

1. CRITICAL ISSUE: Grid Size Mismatch
   - Model trained on 3x3 grids only
   - Re-ARC problems have variable sizes (2x6 to 29x29)
   - Current approach crops/pads to 3x3, losing critical information

2. Action Generation Working
   - Model generates reasonable action sequences
   - Average 2-5 actions per problem
   - Includes submit actions appropriately

3. Single Success Analysis
   - Only 1 success out of 700 attempts (Problem 240)
   - Success rate: 0.14%
   - Suggests underlying model has some capability

=== Comparison with Native 3x3 Test ===

3x3 Native Test Results:
- Accuracy: 87% confidence on native 3x3 grids
- All 3 test cases handled correctly
- Model works well when grid size matches training

Re-ARC Results:
- Accuracy: 0.1% on variable-sized grids
- Massive performance drop due to size mismatch
- 99.9% accuracy loss from grid preprocessing

=== Recommendations ===

1. URGENT: Implement 30x30 Padding Approach
   - Use GFlowNet's padding strategy
   - Train model on 30x30 padded grids
   - Preserve spatial relationships

2. Retrain with Proper Grid Handling
   - Include variable-sized grids in training
   - Use spatial embeddings for position encoding
   - Maintain grid structure information

3. Action Space Validation
   - Current actions (rotate, flip, submit) may be insufficient
   - Re-ARC may require different transformation types
   - Consider expanding action vocabulary

=== Model Architecture Assessment ===

Strengths:
- Trajectory Transformer architecture working
- Good performance on matching grid sizes
- Proper action sequence generation
- Value estimation and reward integration

Weaknesses:
- Grid size handling is catastrophic failure point
- No spatial understanding beyond 3x3
- Information loss in crop/pad preprocessing
- Limited action vocabulary for complex transformations

=== Next Steps ===

1. Complete 30x30 model training
2. Evaluate 30x30 model on Re-ARC
3. Compare 3x3 vs 30x30 performance
4. Consider architecture improvements for spatial understanding
